Summary: <br> 

<br>Virtual OceanGate is a digital replica of an OceanGate manned submersible, 
created in the Second Life virtual world. The purpose of this project was to 
demonstrate how immersive virtual environments can be used to educate, train, 
and inspire people about real world tools and their applications.  <br> 

 <br> My role  <br> 
My role was experience producer, content writer, and presenter, and I collaborated
 with 3D artists, coders, video producers, and front-end developers who helped 
 bring the project and our video presentation to life. <br>

 
 <br> Why does this matter? <br> 
<br> Sending people out in submersibles for training and demonstration purposes is a 
time-consuming and expensive process. With an effective virtual simulation, OceanGate 
could reduce the costs of training, create better-prepared pilots, and more closely monitor 
which areas of preparedness need attention before high-stakes missions in the physical ocean. <br>

 <br> Our Methods: <br> 
<br> As an experience producer and content writer, it was up to me to figure out how to 
make our teaching tool both engaging and educational. Because this was a class on Immersive 
Environments, I first chose to narrow down some key factors of immersion that we would want 
to build as our minimum viable presentation. <br>

<br> According to Bailenson and Scarborough (2014), the three characteristics of virtual 
presence are self-presence, social presence, and spatial presence. In other words, to make 
someone feel virtually immersed, we would have to ensure that users maintained their sense 
of self while in our submersible, create a rich world with sound and visual artifacts on all 
sides, and give users a social framework in which to feel like what they did and said mattered. <br>

<br> Spatial and self-presence were built into our digital, controllable submersible as an 
artifact, but social presence and engagement among 40 audience-members was harder to engineer. <br>

<br>Here, I took inspiration from other games and HCI papers Iâ€™d had exposure to and proposed 
that we gamify the Virtual OceanGate experience by adding rewards for finding key environmental 
artifacts, for exploring certain areas first, and by adding a high-stakes story to the 
demonstration. <br>
