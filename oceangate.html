Summary: <br> 

Virtual OceanGate is a digital replica of an OceanGate manned submersible, created in 
the Second Life virtual world. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how 
immersive virtual environments can be used to educate, train, and inspire people 
about real world tools and their applications.  <br> 

 <br> MY ROLE  <br> 
My role was experience producer, content writer, and presenter, and I collaborated
 with 3D artists, coders, video producers, and front-end developers who helped 
 bring the project and our video presentation to life. <br>

 
 <br> Why does this matter? <br> 
Sending people out in submersibles for training and demonstration purposes is a 
time-consuming and expensive process. With an effective virtual simulation, OceanGate 
could reduce the costs of training, create better-prepared pilots, and more closely monitor 
which areas of preparedness need attention before high-stakes missions in the physical ocean. <br>

 <br> Our Methods: <br> 
Identify and narrow down key components which make for an immersive and engaging experience.
Narrowing down key components of what makes an experience both immersive and compelling, 
while figuring out how we could provide value both to OceanGate and to our own 
classmates/audience who would participate in our 10 minute demonstration.
We found excerpts from readings and took inspiration from other virtual 
worlds to create spatial, social, and self presence by creating a rich environment, 
complete with X, Y, Z…and  <br> 
As such, rather than simply recreate their product, we designed an environment in which 
the underwater submersible could be used to carry out specified tasks.This will highlight 
the spatial immersion of the given environment and allow users to see how the Cyclops 
will improve tomorrows underwater excursions. <br> 

Self presence - “the feeling that one’s avatar is more than a mechanism to interact with 
the virtual environment…it is an extension of the self” – the ability to earn lindens 
(second life money) and both place and see their virtual avatar inside the submersible <br> 

 <br> [insert picture here of me and others in submersible] <br> 

 <br> Social Presence – the feeling of competition with others to get the treasure chests 
and discover the environment <br> 
Spatial presence – a rich world with sounds, physics, and artifacts to discover on all sides.
Engagement – rewards, scavenger hunt, hidden treasures, and the feeling of urgency created 
by the pipeline disaster we had to stop, using the submersible. Not only did we create 
a submersible but we created a story and a compelling reason to use it. <br>
