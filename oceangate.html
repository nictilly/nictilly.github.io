                <p class="s-desc">Virtual OceanGate is a digital replica of an OceanGate manned submersible, 
                    created in the Second Life virtual world. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate 
                    how immersive virtual environments can be used to educate, train, and inspire people about 
                    real world tools and their applications.</p>

                <p class="s-desc">My role was experience producer, content writer, and presenter.
                    I collaborated with 3D artists, coders, video producers, and front-end developers 
                    who helped bring the project to life.</p>

                <p class="s-title">Why Does This Matter?</p>
                <p class="s-desc">Sending people out in submersibles for training and demonstration 
                    purposes is a time-consuming and expensive process. With an effective virtual 
                    simulation, OceanGate could reduce the costs of training, create better-prepared 
                    pilots, and closely monitor which areas of preparedness need attention 
                    before high-stakes ocean missions.</p>

             <p class="s-title">Design Process</p>
                <p class="s-desc"> Our most important task was to get our submersible
                    up and running, but we would only be able to include a few
                    active participants during our product demo. To keep onlookers engaged,
                    we needed a compelling narrative as part of the experience. <br>

                    <br>My job as experience producer was to pinpoint the key
                    factors that would make our experience both engaging and educational for passengers
                    and onlookers alike <br>

                    <br>I used a combination of competitive analysis and literature review to
                    define our key immersion factors, and then took a real mission from the
                    Cyclops 1 as a use case to create a  compelling narrative. </p>

                <p class="s-desc">Presence</p>
                <p class="s-desc">We created a feeling of spatial presence by populating the sea environment
                    with a variety of sea creatures, plants, and objects to explore. Many of these components
                    had their own sounds as well.

                <p class="s-desc">Gamification</p>
                <p class="s-desc">To increase a feeling of engagement and encourage exploration, we added
                    two types of gamification: hidden treasure chests and a scavenger hunt. The treasure
                    chests would reward whoever explored an area first, whereas scavenger hunts gave 
                    participants key markers to look out for. These features created a feeling of social and
                    self presence.

                    onlookers at the edge of their seats, we installed a leaking oil pipeline with a switch
                    into our sea expedition. To preserve the pristine ocean environment, the submersible
                    operator would have to flip the switch by maneuvering just right. It's more difficult 
                    than it sounds!

                <p class="s-desc">
                    For our virtual presentation, we had about 30 onlookings inside Second Life and
                    at least 10 more watching from the chat program Sococo. Our audience was a mixture
                    of our classmates, teachers, and industry professionals from companies like Microsoft
                    and OceanGate. <br>

                    <br>James Reichert, a member of the Microsoft Hololens team, recorded and broadcasted
                    our demo on a big screen in the Microsoft office, writing later: "People can talk about HMDs
                    all they want, but this is truly VR." In his praise, he wrote "It's amazing that they not
                    only built a working 3-seat submersible after a real-world model, but fleshed out an entire
                    lagoon. I felt like this must be Disneyland...but Disneyland wasn't built in two weeks!" <br>

                    <br> Christian Saranson of OceanGate told us he "blown away" by what we had accomplished 
                    in Second Life. This project motivated him to actively pursue the development of a 
                    real virtual training program for his company. <br>

                    <br>To top it off, our 3D modeler and scripter, Mano Barkovics, was invited to the Oceans
                    2016 conference this summer, where he talked about the work we did and the broader 
                    applications to ocean education! </p>
