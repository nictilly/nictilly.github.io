                <p class="s-title">My Role</p>
                <p class="s-desc">I was a researcher and conceptual designer in a team of 3 UW
                    undergraduate students. We also worked with 2 REI UX Designers. I took the
                    lead on literature review, contextual inquiry, storyboards, and user interviews,
                    while others took the lead on project management and visual design. </p>

                <p class="s-desc">REI's Membership Team wanted to know: "How can REI improve
                    member experiences?"

                <p class="s-title">Our Process</p>
                <p class="s-desc"> This was a two-quarter project with a bulk of the time spent on
                    background research, storyboarding, and user interviews to establish and validate
                    a design direction. Here is an overview of the methods we used at each step: </p>

                <p class="s-title">Discovery</p>
                <p class="s-desc">During our discovery phase, we spent 3 weeks on competitive
                     analysis, literature review, market research, and discussion with REI employees.
                     We found that REI is not sufficiently different from it's
                     competition in terms of merchandise, pricing, or membership benefits. In order
                     to compete, REI would need to improve the member experience by
                     to engaging with their consumers on an emotional level. This would influence
                     behavior and value perception. </p>

                <p class="s-title">Concept </p>
                <p class="s-desc"> In our concept phase, we started out by sketching 9 big ideas
                    on paper. We eventually narrowed down to a single design direction through
                    the use of storyboards, card sorting, and a lot of user interviews.

                <p class="s-title">The Final Product </p>
                <p class="s-desc"> In our early research, we found that REI needed to connect
                    emotionally with their members if they wanted to retain loyalty. We learned
                    from REI customers that what they most valued about REI was the expert help from
                    enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff. However, when we went into the stores, we 
                    repeatedly met shoppers who could not find the help they needed, when they
                    needed it. Our design of a reservation system ultimately helps consumers
                    access the trained members most valued by REI
                    in a way that is convenient and memorable.
